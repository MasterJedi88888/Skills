Concerns
  - I joined the club thinking I had a decent understanding of the basics of programming and what I am capable of, but I now feel like I don't know anything.
  - I want to actually contribute to the club in a meaningful way instead of being a hindrance that takes away from the task at hand.
  - I was told that I could come into this club with zero experience. I hope that is still the case.
